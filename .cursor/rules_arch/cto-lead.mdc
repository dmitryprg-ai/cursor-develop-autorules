# 👔 CTO/TECH LEAD REVIEW STANDARD

## Core Principle: IS THIS PRODUCTION-READY?

```
Before merging/deploying, ask:
1. Would I be comfortable if this ran in production tonight?
2. Would another developer understand this code?
3. Will this cause problems at 3 AM?
```

## 1. Architecture Review

### Questions to ask:
- [ ] Is the solution appropriate for the problem size?
- [ ] No over-engineering? (simple problem → simple solution)
- [ ] No under-engineering? (complex problem → robust solution)
- [ ] Follows existing project patterns?
- [ ] Consistent with codebase conventions?

### Architecture Checklist:
```markdown
## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### Appropriateness:
- [ ] Solution matches problem complexity
- [ ] Not over-engineered
- [ ] Not under-engineered

### Consistency:
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] Uses existing abstractions
- [ ] Naming conventions match

### Scalability:
- [ ] Will handle 10x load?
- [ ] No obvious bottlenecks?
- [ ] Database queries optimized?
```

## 2. Code Quality

### Readability:
- [ ] Code is self-documenting
- [ ] Variable names are clear
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"

### Maintainability:
- [ ] Easy to modify later
- [ ] No hidden dependencies
- [ ] Single responsibility principle
- [ ] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Code Quality Checklist:
```markdown

```

## 3. Production Readiness

### Error Handling:
- [ ] All errors caught and handled
- [ ] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Errors logged appropriately
- [ ] User sees friendly messages

### Logging:
- [ ] Key operations logged
- [ ] Log levels appropriate
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Enough info for debugging

### Monitoring:

- [ ] Alerts configured?

### Production Checklist:
```markdown

- [ ] Indexes used
- [ ] Queries optimized
- [ ] Connection pooling

### Memory:
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Large data streamed
- [ ] Caches used appropriately

## 6. Technical Debt Assessment

### New Debt:
- [ ] Does this create tech debt?
- [ ] Is the debt documented?
- [ ] Is there a plan to pay it off?

### Existing Debt:
- [ ] Does this reduce existing debt?
- [ ] Or make it worse?

### Tech Debt Checklist:
```markdown
## 💳 TECHNICAL DEBT

### New Debt Created:
- [ ] Temporary solution: [describe]
- [ ] TODO left: [describe]

- [ ] Patterns are standard

### Team Checklist:
```markdown
## 👥 TEAM UNDERSTANDING

### Documentation:
- [ ] Self-explanatory code
- [ ] Comments on complex parts
- [ ] API docs updated

### Maintainability:
