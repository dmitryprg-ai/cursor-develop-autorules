# 👔 STANDARD: CTO/TECH LEAD REVIEW

> **Используется в:** `protocol-refactoring.mdc`, final quality check
> **Когда применять:** Перед merge/deploy в production

---

## Core Principle: IS THIS PRODUCTION-READY?

```
Before merging/deploying, ask:
1. Был бы я комфортен если это запустится в production сегодня ночью?
2. Поймёт ли другой разработчик этот код?
3. Вызовет ли это проблемы в 3 часа ночи?
```

## 1. ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### Questions to ask:
- [ ] Решение соответствует размеру проблемы?
- [ ] Нет over-engineering? (простая проблема → простое решение)
- [ ] Нет under-engineering? (сложная проблема → robust решение)
- [ ] Следует существующим паттернам проекта?
- [ ] Консистентно с conventions codebase?

---

## 2. CODE QUALITY

### Readability:
- [ ] Код self-documenting
- [ ] Variable names понятные
- [ ] Functions маленькие и focused
- [ ] Нет magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Comments объясняют "why", не "what"

### Maintainability:
- [ ] Easy to modify later
- [ ] No hidden dependencies
- [ ] Single responsibility principle
- [ ] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

---

## 3. PRODUCTION READINESS

### Error Handling:
- [ ] All errors caught and handled
- [ ] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Errors logged appropriately
- [ ] User sees friendly messages

### Logging:
- [ ] Key operations logged
- [ ] Log levels appropriate
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Enough info for debugging

### Monitoring:
- [ ] Can we detect if this breaks?
- [ ] Metrics available?
- [ ] Alerts configured?

---

## 4. SECURITY REVIEW

### Data Security:
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] No secrets in logs
- [ ] Input validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] XSS prevented

### Access Control:
- [ ] Authentication checked
- [ ] Authorization verified
- [ ] Sensitive data protected

---

## 5. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

### Database:
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Indexes used
- [ ] Queries optimized
- [ ] Connection pooling

### Memory:
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Large data streamed
- [ ] Caches used appropriately

---

## 6. TECHNICAL DEBT ASSESSMENT

### New Debt:
- [ ] Does this create tech debt?
- [ ] Is the debt documented?
- [ ] Is there a plan to pay it off?

### Existing Debt:
- [ ] Does this reduce existing debt?
- [ ] Or make it worse?

---

## 7. TEAM UNDERSTANDING

### Documentation:
- [ ] Code is self-explanatory
- [ ] Complex logic documented
- [ ] API documented
- [ ] README updated if needed

### Knowledge Transfer:
- [ ] Other devs can maintain this
- [ ] No "bus factor" of 1
- [ ] Patterns are standard
